		<h2> Travelling ✈ </h2>
		<p> Travelling is very precious to me. I dream of going around the world to discover other cultures than mine. I hope to be lucky enough to have a job that allows me to travel ! Until today, I had the chance to travel to many different countries but I am never satisfied… I always want more, I always want to get better, I always want to climb another step ! </p>

		<h2> The Anime World ⭒ </h2>
		<p> I am in love with anime. I watch a lot of them and no matter what other people think, I learn a lot about life and how to face it. There is something for everyone but my favorite is definitely One Piece. His most inspiring quote to me is  : “Passion and dreams are like time, nothing can stop them, and it will be like that as long as there are men willing to give meaning to the word :  <strong> " FREEDOM " </strong>. </p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="second">
		<h2> Sport & Music  ♫ </h2>
		<p>I have been playing basketball for 6 years and I am a fan of it. I love playing and watching games. I watch a little bit of the NBA but I don’t really have a favorite player (rest in peace Kobe, <strong> the Black Mamba </strong>). It’s funny but I associate basketball with music. I like to listen to US rap music during practice, or even when I go for a run. In fact, I listen to music morning, noon and night… music accompanies me in a big part of my life ! </p>

	<div class="second">
		<h2> My family & My friends ღ </h2>
		<p> I love them more than anything. I love going out with them, having fun and laughing. I will go with them to the end of the world ! I’d rather have friends than a lover (am I really sure that ? haha) as they say if love is the strongest thing in the world,<strong> then friendship is invincible</strong>. 

	 	Special mention to my cat Lilo, I love him too so much.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="second">
	 	<h2> Working 〄 </h2>
		<p> I work hard to achieve my goals. I dream to be an entrepreneur and to fully develop my business. I would like to change the world in my own way and even if it is tough, Horace Mann said it : “Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity.” </p>

		<p> Oh and if you still haven’t noticed I love quotes haha. </p>
